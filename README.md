# quadratic-equation
This program accepts coefficients of a quadratic equation from the user and displays the roots (both real and complex roots depending upon the discriminant).
For a quadratic equation ax2+bx+c = 0 (where a, b and c are coefficients).
The term b2-4ac is known as the discriminant of a quadratic equation. The discriminant tells the nature of the roots.
         --> If discriminant is greater than 0, the roots are real and different.
         --> If discriminant is equal to 0, the roots are real and equal.
         --> If discriminant is less than 0, the roots are complex and different.
